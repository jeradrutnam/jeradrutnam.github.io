### Why dark color backgounds?
<br>
Darker color scheme is oftenly used in softwares that focuses heavily on visual content. ( e.g Dashboards/Insights ).
For example Adobe Lightroom, Adobe After Effects and Microsoft Expression Blend are interfaces that have a dark color theme. 
This allows the interface to fade into the background and let the content come alive.    
<br>

### Why is it not widely used?
<br>
Because it depends on the crowd/users. As this very subjective. For these applications, it tends 
to work out great but many people don't like dark interfaces. At my company I created an interface for a very complicated 
piece of software using a dark UI. It helped to simplify everything and bring attention to the necessary elements at specific times. 
The problem was, a lot of people complained. "It's too dark," "it doesn't look good on my laptop when I am using in 
the bright sun" etc. Some people just hate dark interfaces.     
<br>
Bottom line: if your application is very content driven, esp with visual content, consider a dark interface 
but be prepared for some opposition.

### Alternative solution: Provide 2 themes, one Light and one Dark.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
        <img src="/images/post/wso2ds-light-theme.png" class="img-responsive">
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
        <img src="/images/post/wso2ds-dark-theme.png" class="img-responsive">
    </div>

> Also, it is important to note that it is often a bit more difficult to get a dark interface that works well. 
A little more care must be given to legibility of text on the dark background ( e.g. making it bright enough to 
be legible but not so bright that it is distracting to read ).
